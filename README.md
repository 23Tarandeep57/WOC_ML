# WOC_ML — Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch 

This repository is a collection of **core Machine Learning algorithms** implemented entirely **from scratch** using only **NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib** — with **no use of scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or any ML libraries**.

Developed as part of **Winter of Code (WOC) IIT (ISM) Dhanbad**, this project focuses on understanding the **mathematics** and **internal workings** behind each algorithm.

## Why This Project?

Unlike black-box libraries, this repo is built to help you:
- Understand the **math behind ML algorithms**.
- Learn how algorithms work under the hood.
- Build foundational knowledge by writing each step yourself.

## Implemented Algorithms

| Algorithm                        | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `Linear Regression`              | Fit a straight line to data using gradient descent. |
| `Polynomial Regression`          | Extend linear regression to model non-linear data. |
| `K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)`      | Classify data based on nearest neighbors using Euclidean distance. |
| `K-Means Clustering`             | Unsupervised clustering using centroid updates and assignments. |
| `N-Layered Neural Network`       | Forward and backpropagation implemented from scratch. |
| `Softmax Regression`             | Multi-class logistic regression using softmax activation. |
